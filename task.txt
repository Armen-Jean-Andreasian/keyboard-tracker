The Light Bulb Task

Ask the applicant think of a light switch, and implement a light switch using cPython.
Switch has on/off, wherever it's on the bulb lights.

Same here, a bulb that you can turn on/off, then again.
And instead of lighting, the switch the applicant should make can do anything, like print hello world.

The most important part is: to not have any delays between actions. They should be constantly, one after another.
